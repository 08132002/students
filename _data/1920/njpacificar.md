about_me
> Hi, I'm Natalie, a borderline INTP/J, I find the utmost delight in reading anything that peaks my interest and do tell me
anything bout Elon Musk. I used to burn time watching tv shows, movies and playing games. Although, now, I barely indulge
myself on those things cuz LiFe happened. Anw it's a pleasure to introduce myself.
