about_me
> I am Mathew Gabriel, a 19-year old reader from General Santos City. A lot of people have some love-hate relation towards reading. Most of us hold a book for educational purposes. Yes, I know reading is kinda “boring” well, you’ll be spending a day or two finishing it, but it is like watching a movie through your imagination. As a kid, I fell in love with reading children’s stories. And I spend my time recreating those scenes. The culture of reading a book is slowly dying, and as a reader, it deeply saddened me. I can’t force everyone to like a certain hobby, but I will always try to influence others to read.

> “It’s scary to let people see the real you, even when these people are your own family. But aren’t they the ones we should be least worried about? The ones who will love us without judging, who forgive our faults and celebrate our imperfections, maybe even encourage us to let our true selves shine through.” – Gloria Pritchett
