>  Oh hi there... I am the broke college student Gabriel Constantine B. Belandres but you can call me Gaby. I like a good story, it doesn't matter if it is real or fiction, a good story is still a good story, perhaps one day I could listen or read your story as well.

> "The world is cruel, sadistic enough to make your heart bleed out until it is dry, heartless enough to make you suffocate on your own home; but the people turn a blind eye when witnessing injustice befalling unto others. Why people are like that? Well it's not because of ignorance, and it's also not because they are evil or something; it's just a cold harsh truth that people do not want the same fate as those unfortunate enough to experience suffering so they don't want to be involved." -some random guy on the internet.
