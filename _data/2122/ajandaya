about_me
>  Hi my name is Alecx, I enjoy coding of any kind, apps, websites, games, and simple ones that could be done in an ide. I have been fascinated about technology becuase 
I have been playing video games for a long time now and wish to be working on a job for it. I also aspire to become a software engineer which is what I am developing
my skills for. I have made some personal projects already during my journey and wish that they could be my stepping stone towards reaching my goal.
