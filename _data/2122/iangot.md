Hello Everyone!:grin:
about_me
>  I am 20 years old undergrad CS student currently studying at WVSU. My hobbies is watching K-Dramas or Anime. My favorite genre of movie is Action, and my favorite food is Adobong Baboy. I love deriving things down to their history, how they are made and what they are made of and why where they made.
